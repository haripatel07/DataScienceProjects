# **Building Linear Regression from Scratch for YouTube Ad Revenue Forecasting**

## **Overview**
This project explores the implementation of **linear regression from scratch** to predict YouTube ad revenue based on key video performance metrics. Instead of relying on pre-built libraries like `sklearn`, the model is developed using fundamental mathematical concepts, including **gradient descent and cost function optimization**.

By implementing the model from first principles, this project provides a deeper understanding of regression analysis while demonstrating its practical application in **digital marketing analytics**.

## **Objectives**
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing** – Analyze and prepare YouTube ad revenue data for modeling.  
- **Mathematical Foundations** – Implement core components of linear regression, including **hypothesis function, cost function, and gradient descent** using NumPy.  
- **Model Training & Evaluation** – Train the model on real-world data and evaluate its performance using **R², RMSE, and MAE**.  
- **Comparative Analysis** – Benchmark the custom model against `sklearn`'s `LinearRegression` to assess performance.  

## **Results & Insights**
The model demonstrated strong predictive capability, with key findings including:
- **Accurate revenue predictions** using a well-optimized regression approach.  
- **Performance improvements** over `sklearn`'s implementation, showcasing the benefits of custom optimization.  
- **Actionable insights** into ad revenue trends based on video engagement metrics.  

### **Performance Comparison**
The following scatter plot compares the predictions of the **custom linear regression model** (blue) and **sklearn's LinearRegression model** (red) against actual revenue values.
